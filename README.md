# Whitethorn Morris website

This is a collection of html files together with javascript and css files that make up the new static website for the Whitethorn Morris side.

The site was made using the [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/) template, which is a multipurpose, full website template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This template includes 17 unique HTML pages and a working PHP contact form (which was removed).
